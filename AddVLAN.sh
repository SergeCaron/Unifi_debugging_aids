# Configure a (temporary) VLAN (bridge) on a Unifi AP hosting a "virtual wire" interface.
#
# Usage: ./AddVLAN VLAN [ Management_VLAN ]
#
# Where:
#		./AddVLAN is the script name. Please note that, on a Unifi AP, the HOME directory
#						is "/etc/persistent". You can name the script anything you want ...
#
#		VLAN is the VLAN number you want to add to the Linux bridge filtering feature
#
#		Management_VLAN is the Unifi Network management VLAN for your site. The parameter is
#						included in case this code fails to detect the management VLAN,
#						implying yhere is a bug in this code.
#
# Upon successful execution, the process will request an IP from a DHCP server
# running on VLAN and the user is asked to supply a network mask: if you don't want to
# assign an IP to this new bridge (for example, if all you want is to run tcpdump
# against this new interface), you can abort (^C) the process and the new bridge is up.
# If you supply a netmask, this netmask and the IP retrieved from the DHCP server
# are assigned to the new bridge without further validation. No configuraton files
# are modified by this process.
#

# Remember if the bridge software should be running
